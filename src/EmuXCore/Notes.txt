This file is meant to inform the programmer, for whom that may be, of things to have in mind before doing any changes to the source code.

1) Please follow the C# conventions as described by Microsoft
2) Keep in mind this solution is supposed to be cross platform, so no specific platform dependencies should ever be added to the source code
3) The class KeyboardInterruptHandler must be the only class, as of now, to be inherited from to add the platform specific functionality outside of the EmuXCore solution
4) All instructions must inherit from the IInstruction interface and be a sealed class
5) All components of the IVirtualMachine must inherit the IVirtualComponent interface
